# Introduction

A jupyter book for data analysis of my zerodha stocks by Jay Rajput (jayrajput.com)

# Guidelines

## Manual
- Do not time the market.
- Do not try to catch a falling knife.
- Act with deliberation. Do not sell, when everyone is selling. Greater the deliberation, better the output
- A falling tide takes all. The ILF&S fiasco impacted both good and bad NBFCs and others.
- Watch carefully for clues
- Use Systematic Transfer Plan rather than investing lump-sum amount.

## Automated

- If your stocks are falling steeply and failing to recover even with good news, you may have to book your losses
